## crossorigin 
- The crossorigin attribute, valid on the <audio>, <img>, <link>, <script>, and <video> elements, provides support for CORS, defining how the element handles cross-origin requests, thereby enabling the configuration of the CORS requests for the element's fetched data. Depending on the element, the attribute can be a CORS settings attribute.
The crossorigin content attribute on media elements is a CORS settings attribute.

These attributes are enumerated, and have the following possible values:

anonymous  
Request uses CORS headers and credentials flag is set to 'same-origin'. There is no exchange of user credentials via cookies, client-side SSL certificates or HTTP authentication, unless destination is the same origin.

use-credentials  
Request uses CORS headers, credentials flag is set to 'include' and user credentials are always included.

""  
Setting the attribute name to an empty value, like crossorigin or crossorigin="", is the same as anonymous.

An invalid keyword and an empty string will be handled as the anonymous keyword.

By default (that is, when the attribute is not specified), CORS is not used at all. The user agent will not ask for permission for full access to the resource and in the case of a cross-origin request, certain limitations will be applied based on the type of element concerned.
